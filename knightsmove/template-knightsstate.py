    Describes a 8x8 square board, occupied by 0 - 64 identical 'knight' game 
    pieces.

    Each board configuration is a state, and an action consists of moving one
    game piece.

    The game state is described by the occupied board locations. A new state 
    is derived by moving one piece to an unoccupied location in accordance with 
    a chess knight move.
